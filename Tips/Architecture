State Management

	Redux is useful if your component:
		Uses I/O like network or device APIs.
		Saves or loads state.
		Shares its state with non-child components.
		Deals with any business logic or data processing shared with other parts of the application.

	Likewise Hook if your component:
		Doesn’t use the network.
		Doesn’t save or load state.
		Doesn’t share state with other non-child components.
		Does need some ephemeral local component state
